<p class="tab">The Computer Hope <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/forum.htm">forum</a> have thousands of active participants who are knowledgeable in numerous different fields of computers. Because there are thousands of different people helping in the forums, you will likely get an answer to your question quicker than sending Computer Hope an e-mail.</p>
<p class="tab">Visit the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/forum/">Computer Hope forums</a> to ask for help with your questions or get help for issues you are experiencing.</p>
<h2 id="register">How do I register?</h2>

<p class="tab">The username and password are <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/casesens.htm">case sensitive</a>, which means if your username was &quot;chuser&quot; and you attempted to log in as &quot;CHUSER,&quot; you would get this error.

<h2 id="forgot">I forgot my password or my password doesn&#39;t work</h2>
<p class="tab">Use the forgot password feature to have your password sent to your e-mail address. If you did not receive this e-mail or no longer have it, you can <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/forum?action=reminder">have a reminder e-mail sent to you</a>.
