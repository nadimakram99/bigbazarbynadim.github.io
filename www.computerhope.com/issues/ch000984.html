<h2 id="computer">When was the word &quot;computer&quot; was first used?</h2>
<p class="tab">The word &quot;computer&quot; was first used in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1600.htm">1613</a> and originally described a human who performed calculations or computations. The definition of a computer remained the same until the end of the 19th century, when the industrial revolution gave rise to machines whose primary purpose was calculating.</p>
<h2 id="mechanical">First mechanical computer or automatic computing engine concept</h2>
<p class="tab">In <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1800.htm">1822</a>, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/charles_babbage.htm">Charles Babbage</a> conceptualized and began developing the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/diffengi.htm">Difference Engine</a>, considered to be the first automatic computing machine. The Difference Engine was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hardcopy.htm">hard copies</a> of the results. Babbage received some help with development of the Difference Engine from <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/ada_lovelace.htm">Ada Lovelace</a>, considered by many to be the first computer programmer for her work and notes on the Difference Engine. Unfortunately, because of funding, Babbage was never able to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. In June <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1991.htm">1991</a>, the London Science Museum completed the Difference Engine No 2 for the bicentennial year of Babbage&#39;s birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000.</p>
<p class="tab"><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/analyten.htm"><img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/analytical-engine.jpg" width="200" height="187" alt="Analytical Engine" class="floatRightIcon"></a>In <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1800.htm">1837</a>, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, the <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/analyten.htm">Analytical Engine</a></b>. The Analytical Engine contained an ALU (<a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/alu.htm">Arithmetic Logic Unit</a>), basic <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/flowcont.htm">flow control</a>, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/punccard.htm">punch cards</a> (inspired by the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/j/jacquard-loom.htm">Jacquard Loom</a>), and integrated <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm">memory</a>. It is the first general-purpose computer concept. Unfortunately, because of funding issues, this computer was also never built while Charles Babbage was alive. In <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/190040.htm">1910</a>, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage&#39;s youngest son, was able to complete a portion of this machine and was able to perform basic calculations.</p>
<h2 id="programmable">First programmable computer</h2>
<p class="tab">The <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/z/z1.htm">Z1</a></b> was created by German <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/konrad_zuse.htm">Konrad Zuse</a> in his parents&#39; living room between <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/190040.htm">1936</a> and 1938. It is considered to be the first electromechanical <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/binary.htm">binary</a> programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer.</p>
<p class="ce"><img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/z1.jpg" width="597" height="429" alt="Z1 computer" class="resize600"></p>
<h2 id="modern">First concepts of what we consider a modern computer</h2>
<p class="tab">The <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/turnmach.htm">Turing machine</a> was first proposed by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/alan_turing.htm">Alan Turing</a> in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/190040.htm">1936</a> and became the foundation for theories about computing and computers. The machine was a device that printed symbols on paper tape in a manner that emulated a person following a series of logical instructions. Without these fundamentals, we wouldn&#39;t have the computers we use today.</p>
<h2 id="electric">The first electric programmable computer</h2>
<img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/colossus.jpg" width="340" height="231" alt="Colossus Mark 2" class="floatRight"><p class="tab">The <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/colossus.htm">Colossus</a></b> was the first electric programmable computer, developed by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/thomas_flowers.htm">Tommy Flowers</a>, and was first demonstrated in December <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1943.htm">1943</a>. The <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/colossus.htm">Colossus</a> was created to help the British code breakers read encrypted German messages.</p>
<h2 id="digital">The first digital computer</h2>
<p class="tab">Short for <b>Atanasoff-Berry Computer</b>, the <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/abc.htm">ABC</a></b> began development by Professor <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/john_atanasoff.htm">John Vincent Atanasoff</a> and graduate student <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/clifford_berry.htm">Cliff Berry</a> in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/190040.htm">1937</a>. Its development continued until 1942 at the Iowa State College (now Iowa State University).</p>
<p class="tab">The ABC was an electrical computer that used more than 300 <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/vacuumtu.htm">vacuum tubes</a> for digital computation, including binary math and <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/boolean.htm">Boolean</a> logic and had no <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cpu.htm">CPU</a> (was not programmable). On October 19, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1973.htm">1973</a>, US Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision that the ENIAC patent by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly was invalid. In the decision, Larson named Atanasoff the sole inventor.</p>
<p class="tab">The <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/eniac.htm">ENIAC</a></b> was invented by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/john_eckert.htm">J. Presper Eckert</a> and <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/john_mauchly.htm">John Mauchly</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1943.htm">1943</a> and was not completed until <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1946.htm">1946</a>. It occupied about 1,800 square feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. Although the Judge ruled that the ABC computer was the first digital computer, many still consider the ENIAC to be the first digital computer because it was fully functional.</p>
<p class="ce"><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/eniac.htm"><img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/eniac.jpg" width="600" height="459" alt="ENIAC" class="resize600"></a></p>
<h2 id="program">The first stored program computer</h2>
<img src="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/ssem-program.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="First electronically stored program to be executed by a computer, written by Tom Kilburn in 1948 for the SSEM." class="floatRight">
<p class="tab">The first computer to electronically store and execute a program was the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/ssem.htm">SSEM</a> (Small-Scale Experimental Machine), also known as the &quot;Baby&quot; or &quot;Manchester Baby,&quot; in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1948.htm">1948</a>. It was designed by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/frederic_williams.htm">Frederic Williams</a>, and built by his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/tom_kilburn.htm">Tom Kilburn</a>, with the assistance of Geoff Tootill, at the University of Manchester, England. Kilburn wrote the first electronically-stored program, which finds the highest proper factor of an <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/integer.htm">integer</a>, using repeated subtraction rather than division. Kilburn&#39;s program was executed on June 21, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1948.htm">1948</a>.</p>
<p class="tab"> The second stored-program computer was also British: the <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/edsac.htm">EDSAC</a></b>, built and designed by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/maurice_wilkes.htm">Maurice Wilkes</a> at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. The EDSAC performed its first calculation on May 6, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1949.htm">1949</a>. It was also the first computer to run a graphical computer game, &quot;OXO,&quot; an implementation of tic-tac-toe displayed on a 6-inch <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/crt.htm">cathode ray tube</a>.</p>
<p class="tab"><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/edsac.htm"><img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/edsac.jpg" width="301" height="221" alt="EDSAC" class="floatLeft"></a> <img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/manchester-mark-1.jpg" alt="Manchester Mark 1" width="300" height="223"></p>
<p class="tab">Around the same time, the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mark-1.htm"><b>Manchester Mark 1</b></a> was another computer that could run stored programs. Built at the Victoria University of Manchester, the first version of the Mark 1 computer became operational in April <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1949.htm">1949</a>. Mark 1 was used to run a program to search for Mersenne <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/prime-number.htm">primes</a> for nine hours without error on June 16 and 17 that same year.</p>
<h2 id="company">The first computer company</h2>
<p class="tab">The first computer company was the <b>Electronic Controls Company</b> and was founded in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1949.htm">1949</a> by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the same individuals who helped create the ENIAC computer. The company was later renamed to EMCC or Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation and released a series of mainframe computers under the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/u/univac.htm">UNIVAC</a> name.</p>
<h2 id="memory">First computer with program stored in memory</h2>
<img src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/univac-1101.jpg" width="216" height="139" alt="UNIVAC 1101" class="floatRightIcon"><p class="tab">First delivered to the United States government in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1950.htm">1950</a>, the <b>UNIVAC 1101</b> or <b>ERA 1101</b> is considered to be the first computer capable of storing and running a program from memory.</p>
<h2 id="commercial">First commercial computer</h2>
<p class="tab">In 1942, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/konrad_zuse.htm">Konrad Zuse</a> begin working on the <b>Z4</b> that later became the first commercial computer. The computer was sold to Eduard Stiefel, a mathematician of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich on July 12, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1950.htm">1950</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ibm">IBM&#39;s first computer</h2>
<p class="tab">On April 7, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1953.htm">1953</a>, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/comp/ibm.htm">IBM</a> publicly introduced the <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/num/701.htm">701</a></b>, its first commercial scientific computer.</p>
<h2 id="ram">The first computer with RAM</h2>
<p class="tab">MIT introduces the <b>Whirlwind machine</b> on March 8, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1955.htm">1955</a>, a revolutionary computer that was the first digital computer with <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/core.htm">magnetic core RAM</a> and real-time graphics.</p>

<h2 id="desktop">The first desktop and mass-market computer</h2>
<p class="tab">In <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1964.htm">1964</a>, the first desktop computer, the <b>Programma 101</b>, was unveiled to the public at the New York World&#39;s Fair. It was invented by Pier Giorgio Perotto and manufactured by Olivetti. About 44,000 Programma 101 computers were sold, each with a price tag of $3,200.</p>
<p class="tab">In <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/history/1968.htm">1968</a>, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/comp/hp.htm">Hewlett Packard</a> began marketing the <b>HP 9100A</b>, considered to be the first mass-marketed desktop computer.</p>
<h2 id="workstation">The first workstation</h2>
<p class="tab">Although it was never sold, the first <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/workstat.htm">workstation</a> is considered to be the <b><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/comp/xerox.htm">Xerox</a> Alto</b>, introduced in 1974. The computer was revolutionary for its time and included a fully functional computer, display, and <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mouse.htm">mouse</a>. The computer operated like many computers today utilizing <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/windows.htm">windows</a>, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/menu.htm">menus</a> and <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/icon.htm">icons</a> as an interface to its operating system. Many of the computer&#39;s capabilities were first demonstrated in <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/the-mother-of-all-demos.htm">The Mother of All Demos</a> by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/douglas_engelbart.htm">Douglas Engelbart</a> on December 9, 1968.</p>
